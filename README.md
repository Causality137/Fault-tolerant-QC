Fault tolerant Quantum Circuits ensure that any single qubit errors in a qubit is corrected at several steps of implementing a quantum logic. These steps include encoding, applying of gates, decoding and measurement.
The code provides a method to encode a qubit into a seven qubit code, and provides with the encoded gates which can apply quantum logics on the encoded states.
